        <p>My name is Belizaire Bassette II and I am a sophmore with a 3.3 GPA majoring in <strong>Information Security Management</strong></p>
    
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>What got me to show interest into computers is the fact that as a child I grew a fascination to technology and how it works.
            I went to <strong>American Heritage Highschool</strong> where I obtained a 3.5 GPA and played football and also ended up earning multiple college football scholarships and choosing <strong>Syracuse University</strong>.
            I ended up having a season ending injury making me stay away from the field for about a year. I am planning to return soon. Football taught me discipline 
            and it shown me that I accomplish anything. But with the time i've been away from football has made me gain a passion for technology and I am willing to 
            learn the ins and outs of this subject because it is interestng to me.<br> </p>
